Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in the Clear Score Frontend Assessment.

For the project I used ReactJs with Typescript and SASS for styling.

The approach taken was to try be as unique as possible and also try build a very simple and straightforward application. Components are broken down into smaller pieces and the code is written in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.

I added a utils file to the project which contains some helper functions.
I also added a component called "Loading" which is used to display a loading spinner.
I added an api folder to the project which contains the api calls and all the models.

I broke down reusable text into ENUMS in the enums folder.

I added an external font to the project which is used in the application.
I also used mixins and variables to style the application.
